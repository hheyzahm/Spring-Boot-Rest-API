 * The EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository. You have two parameters passed to the JpaRepository -
 *  first parameter is the model class that will be managed by this repository, second is the data type
 *  of the primary key.
 *
 * The JpaRepository interface provided by Spring Data JPA makes it possible for the repository class
 * to retrieve, update, delete records in the employee table.
 *
 * This interface also defines methods such as save(), findAll() , delete(), to operate on the database.
 * The implementation of these methods is provided by the default implementation class called SimpleJpaRepository. You have to make a call to these methods thus saving you from writing queries for these operations.
